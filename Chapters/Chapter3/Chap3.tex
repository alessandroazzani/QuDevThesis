In quantum computing, a \emph{graph state} \cite{graph_state, rohde-graph-states} is a specific kind of multi-qubit state that can be depicted using a graph, where the nodes represent qubits and the edges represent entangling gates.
At the same time, the adjacency matrix encodes the stabilizers of the state, which is a complete set of eigenvalue equations satisfied by the state. 

They have many applications, including \emph{Measurement-Based Quantum Computing} (MBQC) \cite{MBQC}.
In MBQC, algorithms can be converted from gate sequences into a series of measurements and their respective bases. This allows for the execution of quantum algorithms through sequential measurement operations on a resource state, providing an alternative implementation approach.

Graph states serve as foundational structures preceding \emph{cluster states} in quantum computing \cite{cluster_state}.
Cluster states, which are closely related to graph states, are essential for enabling universal quantum computation, as they are a resource for \emph{Universal MBQC}.
