\chapter{Graph States}
\label{Chap:graph_states}

\emph{Graph states} \cite{graph_state, rohde-graph-states} own their name to the several constituents associated with graphs.
It can be understood as a summary of the interactions between particles, represented by the nodes.
At the same time, the adjacency matrix encodes the stabilizers of the state, which is a complete set of eigenvalue equation satisfied by the state. 

They are incredibly useful as they enable \emph{Measurement Based Quantum Computing} (MBQC) \cite{MBQC}.
In MBQC, computation proceeds only by measuring qubits from a graph state of some topology, which is usually a lattice, where the order and basis in which qubits are measured dictates the implemented computation.
