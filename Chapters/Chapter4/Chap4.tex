The work by Y. Zhan \emph{et al.} \cite{tree_graph_state} highlighted the central challenge of reliably transmitting quantum signals through noisy and lossy channels.

While conventional quantum repeater proposals relied on heraled entanglement generation and two-way classical signaling, recent proposals have been made towards leveraging \emph{photonic graph states} to overcome these challenges.
These graph-state-based quantum repeaters \cite{One_way_quantum_repeaters} present a promising alternative by employing quantum encoding to address photon losses and operational errors, ultimately bypassing the necessity for extensive quantum memory coherence times.

However, generating such photonic graph states traditionally demands substantial resources and intricate methodologies involving linear optics and a considerable amounts of auxiliary qubits.
Despite this challenge, various schemes have been proposed for deterministic generation of these states, including \emph{tree graph} and \emph{repeater graph states}.

This section will look into how we can create these graph states using our device. 
In the previous sections, we have described the key steps to make specific types of graphs and entanglement bonds between the qubits in our device.
Now, we will explore how to use these tools to generate these graph states, with potential future applications in quantum networking.
