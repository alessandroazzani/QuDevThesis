\section{Storage-Emitter}
\label{sec:S-E}

In \cref{fig:level_S-E} we illustrate the level diagram for a storage-emitter (S-E) system.
\begin{figure}[h]

    \label{fig:level_S-E}
\end{figure}

We label the levels of the storage qubit with $\ket{g}, \ket{e}, \ket{f}$ and those of the emitter as $\ket{0}, \ket{1}$.
Due to the rapid emission of the emitter, the second excited level $\ket{2}$ is not relevant for our purposes.
In addition, we cannot run single-qubit gates on the emitter.
The only operations we can execute are single-qubits gate on the storage qubit and two-qubit gates that do not require single-qubit gates on the emitter.
In other words, we can only transfer the excitation from the storage to the emitter.

The two-qubit gates we are able to execute considering the limitations of our device are SWAP and controlled emission (or CNOT).

\subsection{SWAP}

    \caption{Protocol for executing an S-E SWAP gate}
    \label{fig:S-E_SWAP}
\end{figure}

The simplest two-qubit gate executable on an S-E pair is the SWAP gate. 
It facilitates the mapping of the storage qubit's state onto the emitter qubit, consequently leading to photon emission through spontaneous decay into the emission line of the ladder.

Another application of this gate is device resetting.
Given the emitter qubit's rapid decay, typically residing in the ground state, the SWAP gate reliably resets the storage qubit's state to the ground state.

The unitary matrix representing the SWAP gate is
\begin{equation}
    U_{\text{SWAP}} = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}

This implements the operation
\begin{equation}
    \ket{\psi}_{\text{S}} \ket{0}_{\text{E}} \xrightarrow{U_{\text{SWAP}}}
    \ket{g}_{\text{S}} \ket{\psi}_{\text{E}}
\end{equation}
which transfer the quantum state of the storage in the emitter qubit, leaving the former in its ground state.

The depicted sequence shown in \cref{fig:S-E_SWAP} illustrates the operations required to execute the SWAP gate between a storage and an emitter.
First, an arbitrary state is prepared on the storage qubit through single-qubit operations.
Following this, a $\pi$ rotation is induced within the $e0$-$g1$ manifold of the two-qubit system.
Lastly, upon decay of the emitter qubit, a photon is emitted in the emission line, preserving the state initially encoded by the storage qubit.

\subsection{CNOT}

The other operation that we can run between storage and emitter qubits is a controlled emission, or CNOT.
The unitary matrix representing this operation is
\begin{equation}
    U_{\text{CNOT}} = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}

A photon is emitted form the emitter qubit only if the storage qubit is in the excited state $\ket{e}$, otherwise no photon is emitted.
Thus, it performs the operation
\begin{equation}
    \ket{\psi}_{\text{S}} \ket{0}_{\text{E}} = 
    (\alpha \ket{g0} + \beta \ket{e0})_{\text{SE}} \xrightarrow{U_{\text{CNOT}}}
    (\alpha \ket{g0} + \beta \ket{e1})_{\text{SE}} .
\end{equation}

This observation highlights that, since the final state cannot be expressed as a tensor product of two individual pure states, the resulting state is entangled.

    \label{fig:SE_CNOT}
\end{figure}

Due to the strong coupling between the emitter and the emission line, we cannot depend on operations that involve transferring population to the emitter qubit and its subsequent return.
Essentially, our capability allows only for a $\pi$ rotation between the storage and emitter qubits.
Hence, in executing a CNOT gate within our protocol, the initial step involves population transfer from the $e0$ to the $f0$ state through a single-qubit $\pi$ rotation. 
Subsequently, a $\pi$ rotation within the $f0$-$e1$ manifold is performed, effectively transferring the state from the $e0$ level to the $e1$ level within the two-qubit system.

The protocol employed for executing the controlled emission is depicted in \cref{fig:SE_CNOT}.
Within the diagram, the entanglement between the two qubits is denoted by a red line. We will discuss what we mean by entanglement when dealing with graph states in \textcolor{red}{reference section}.

Please note, this method effectively executes a CNOT gate within the S-E manifold, operating under the assumption that the emitter qubit is predominantly in its ground state $\ket{0}$, a condition frequently observed.
