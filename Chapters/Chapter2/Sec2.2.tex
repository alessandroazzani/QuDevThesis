\label{sec:S-S}

In the Storage-Storage system (S-S), the extended lifetime of the two qubits allows us to execute single-qubit gates on them.
Additionally, the capability to perform $2\pi$ rotations on the sidebands of this two-qubit system enables the implementation of a CZ gate within the S-S system.

\end{figure}

In \cref{fig:SS_level}, the energy levels of the two-qubits system is shown, together with some single- and two-qubit gates that we can run on them.

\subsection{CZ}

The unitary matrix representing a controlled-phase gate, or CZ, is
\begin{equation}
    U_{\text{CZ}} = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}

It performs the operation
\begin{equation}
    (\alpha \ket{gg} + \beta \ket{ge} + \gamma \ket{eg} + \delta \ket{ee})_{\text{S}_1 \text{S}_2} \xrightarrow{U_{\text{CZ}}}
    (\alpha \ket{gg} + \beta \ket{ge} + \gamma \ket{eg} - \delta \ket{ee})_{\text{S}_1 \text{S}_2} . 
\end{equation}

The operational sequence on our device involves transferring population between the states $\ket{ee}$ and $\ket{fg}$ within the S-S system.
After a $2\pi$ rotation, the population returns to the $\ket{ee}$ state, but with an opposite phase (see \cref{fig:SS_CZ}), effectively implementing a CZ gate.

In this context, it is necessary to calibrate the interaction between the $ee$ and $fg$ energy levels.
For this purpose, we employ the previously derived model, using \cref{eq:chevron} to perform fitting on the data.
Figure ?? shows the data and the respective fit.
It also shows the operational point for implementing the CZ gate.
This operational point is given by
\begin{equation}
    \widetilde{t} = \frac{1}{2 g_0}.
\end{equation}
On Figure ?? is also depicted the first oscillation period as a function of the detuning $\delta$, given by
\begin{equation}
    t = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 g_0^2 + \delta^2}} . 
\end{equation}
