\label{sec:S-S}

In the S-S system, the extended lifetime of the two qubits allows us to execute single-qubit gates on them.
Additionally, the capability to perform $2\pi$ rotations on the sidebands of this two-qubit system enables the implementation of a CZ gate within the S-S system.

In \cref{fig:SS_level}, the energy levels of the two-qubits system is shown, together with some single- and two-qubit gates that we can run on them.

\subsection{CZ}

The unitary matrix representing a controlled-phase gate, or CZ, is
\begin{equation}
    U_{\text{CZ}} = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}

It performs the operation
\begin{equation}
    (\alpha \ket{gg} + \beta \ket{ge} + \gamma \ket{eg} + \delta \ket{ee})_{\text{S}_1 \text{S}_2} \xrightarrow{U_{\text{CZ}}}
    (\alpha \ket{gg} + \beta \ket{ge} + \gamma \ket{eg} - \delta \ket{ee})_{\text{S}_1 \text{S}_2} . 
\end{equation}

The operational sequence on our device involves transferring population between the states $\ket{ee}$ and $\ket{fg}$ within the S-S system.
After a $2\pi$ rotation, the population returns to the $\ket{ee}$ state, but with an opposite phase.

This gate isn't feasible within the S-E system as it necessitates a full $2\pi$ rotation, which isn't reliably achievable.
Moreover, it doesn't make sense as we can't distinguish between a CZ gate and an identity gate, given our inability to sustain the $\ket{e1}$ state.
