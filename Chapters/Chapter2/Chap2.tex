\chapter{Two-qubit Gates}
\label{chap:2_qubit_gates}
\thispagestyle{fancy}

To execute experiments and induce the emission of entangled photons into the waveguide, conducting both single- and two-qubit gates on our device is essential.
As explained in the preceding chapter, conducting single-qubit gates on the emitter qubits is not viable due to their short coherence times.
This limitation also influences the type of two-qubit gate feasible between a storage and an emitter qubit.
For instance, we are unable to perform a controlled-phase gate, or CZ gate, between a storage and an emitter, as we will explain later on.

In this chapter, we will first model the sideband transitions of the two-qubits systems which enables us to implement the two-qubit gates on our device.
Then, we will discuss the types of two-qubit gates that we can perform between storage-storage and storage-emitter qubits.
The gates we are able or unable to perform is the main limiting factor affecting the number of entangled photonic states we can create with our device.
