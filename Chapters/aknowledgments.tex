%I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Andreas Wallraff for the opportunity and the Quantum Optics team for their guidance during my first lab experience in the Quantum Device Lab.
%Special thanks to Alonso and Sasha for their feedback and support, and especially to Xi for his crucial help with the crosstalk cancellation measurements.

I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Andreas Wallraff for the opportunity to conduct this project within the Quantum Device Lab and the Quantum Optics team for their guidance during my first experimental work in a physics lab.
In particular, I am also grateful for the support and feedback given by Alonso during the project.
Finally, special thanks goes to Xi, for the huge help he gave me during the measurements phase.
