\chapter{Experimental Setup}
\label{Chap:experimental}

In this chapter we introduce the experimental setup used for our experiments.
We start by presenting the design of our implementation of a qubit: the Transmon.
Then we will show how the qubit is driven for our purposes, in particular how to perform readout and 2-qubit gates.

Finally we put everything together and present the chip used for quantum entangling and photon emission.
