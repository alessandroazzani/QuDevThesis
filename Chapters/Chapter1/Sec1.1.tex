\section{The Qubit}
\label{sec:qubit}

The basic idea behind the implementation of a quantum device for quantum information is realizing a 2-level quantum system.
In the Quantum Device Lab this is done through superconducting circuits.
The qubits are star-shaped transmon qubits \cite{transmon_qubits}.
They are characterized by a large capacitor and a SQUID (see \cref{fig:transmon_circuit}).
The latter is flux-tunable and it is made out of two Josephson junctions in parallel.

The Hamiltonian representing the dynamics of such a transmon is 
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H} = E_C (\hat{N} - N_g)^2 - E_{J_0, \text{max}} \cos(\pi\frac{\Phi_{\text{ext}}}{\Phi_0})\cos\hat{\delta}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{N}$ is the operator of number of Cooper pairs in the island and $\hat{\delta}$ is the phase operator of the transmon.
This can be seen as a non-linear harmonic oscillator.

By changing the external magnetic flux through the SQUID $\Phi_\text{ext}$, it's possible to change the energy splitting between the first two energy levels $\ket{g}$ and $\ket{e}$, and thus the frequency of the qubit.
Furthermore, the anharmonicity allows us to access the first and second transition separately, since they have different energy gaps (see \cref{fig:qubit_energy}).
Nevertheless, it is important to mention that in our particular setup the qubits are not flux-tunable, because it is not useful for out purposes.
We will present our setup in more detail in \Cref{sec:our_setup}.
The qubits are also coupled to a charge line, which is used to perform single-qubits rotations.

The qubits are star-shaped and made out of niobium(see \cref{fig:transmon_squid_images}), fabricated on a silicon substrate.
