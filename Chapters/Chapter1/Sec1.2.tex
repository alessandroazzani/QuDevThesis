\section{Waveguides}
\label{sec_waveguides}

To regulate and execute operations on the qubits, we utilize waveguides.
These waveguides are typically capacitively linked to the qubit, facilitating the implementation of single- and two-qubit operations, flux tuning, and readout procedures.

\subsection{Flux line}

The primary waveguide, denoted as the \emph{flux line}, it is not capacitively coupled to the qubit.
Its role lies in altering the magnetic field entering the SQUID loop to adjust its frequency.
This adjustment is achieved by modulating the current within the flux line, thereby generating the magnetic field within the SQUID loop (see \cref{fig:diagram_storage_qubit}).

\subsection{Charge line}

The \emph{charge line} serves to execute single-qubit gates on the transmon qubit.
It is capacitively linked to the central island of the qubit.
A coherent drive of time-dependent amplitude $\varepsilon(t)$, frequency $\omega_d$ and phase $\phi_d$ is modeled by the Hamiltonian \cite{LC_resonator}
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H} = \frac{\hbar \delta}{2} \hat{\sigma}_z + 
    \hbar \varepsilon(t) \left( \cos(\phi_d) \hat{\sigma}_x + \sin(\phi_d) \hat{\sigma}_y \right) ,
\end{equation}
where the Hamiltonian is expressed within a frame rotating at $\omega_d$, and $\delta$ represents the detuning between the qubit and the drive. 
This illustrates how the phase $\phi_d$ of the drive enables the selection of rotations around either the $x$ or $y$ axis. 
For example, when $\delta = 0$, setting $\phi_d = 0$ executes a rotation around the $x$ axis, while $\phi = \pi/2$ corresponds to a rotation around the $y$ axis. 
Given that any rotation on the Bloch sphere can be decomposed into rotations around two axes, we can implement any single-qubit gate by sequencing the appropriate gates with the corresponding phases.

\subsection{Readout resonator}

The readout mechanism comprises two primary components: the \emph{readout resonator} and the \emph{Purcell filter}. 
Its objective is to measure the state of the qubit in a non-destructive manner \cite{singleshot_readout}.

The starting point is the famous Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian \cite{haroche2006exploring}
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H} = \hbar \omega_r \hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a} + \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega_{ge} \hat{\sigma}_z + \hbar g (\hat{a}^\dagger \hat{\sigma}^- + \hat{a} \hat{\sigma}^+) ,
\end{equation}
which models the interaction between a two-level system with transition frequency $\omega_{ge}$ and an electromagnetic field mode at frequency $\omega_r$.
In the dispersive regime ($|\omega_r - \omega_{ge} \gg g|$), the Hamiltonian reduces to \cite{transmon_regime}
\begin{align}
    \hat{H} &= \hbar \omega_r \hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a} + \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega_{ge} \hat{\sigma}_z + \hbar \chi \hat{\sigma}_z \hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a} \\
    &= \hbar (\omega_r + \chi \hat{\sigma}_z ) \hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a} +
    \frac{1}{2} \hbar \omega_{ge} \hat{\sigma}_z 
\end{align}
where $\chi$ is the qubit-state dependent cavity-shift.

Thus, the resonator's frequency becomes qubit-state's dependent.
If, for instance, the qubit is in the $\ket{g}$ state, then the resonator's frequency will become $\omega_r - \chi$.
On the other hand, if the qubit is in the $\ket{e}$ state, then the resonator's frequency will be $\omega_r + \chi$.
The frequency of the resonator can be determined by assessing the transmission of an input signal through the feedline (see \cref{fig:diagram_storage_qubit}).
This transmission decreases when the signal is on resonance with the resonator's frequency.

In case where the qubit is in a mixed state like
\begin{equation}
    c_g \ket{g} + c_e \ket{e} ,
\end{equation}
then driving the resonator would results in an entangled state between the coherent signal and the qubit
\begin{equation}
    c_g \ket{g, \alpha_g} + c_e \ket{e, \alpha_e} .
\end{equation}
Thus, measuring either $\alpha_g$ or $\alpha_e$ will collapse the state of the qubit onto $\ket{g}$ or $\ket{e}$, respectively.
The principle underlying quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement is predicated on the stability of the state post-measurement.
This implies that subsequent QND measurements would yield identical results, as the state remains unchanged.

To prevent excessive coupling between the qubit and its environment via the readout resonator, a Purcell filter is interposed between them.
This configuration helps extend the qubit lifetimes by mitigating spontaneous emission resulting from the Purcell effect \cite{Purcell_effect}.

\subsection{Tunable couplers}

\end{figure}

We employ \emph{tunable couplers} \cite{tun_coupler} to control interactions between pairs of qubits.
They allow us to mediate interaction between the qubits and perform two-qubits gates.
They are composed of two coplanar waveguides (see \cref{fig:tun_coupl}).
One of them is a normal waveguide, and thus has a fixed coupling term $J_\text{fixed}$.
The other has a SQUID loop and is flux tunable.
Its coupling term $J_\text{tunable}(\phi)$ can be tuned with the magnetic flux generated by a flux line and going into a SQUID loop placed on the waveguide

The SQUID loop connected to the coupler allows us to control the interaction between the two qubits. 
To minimise the interaction between the two qubits and the ZZ crosstalk, the DC flux driving the SQUID loop has to be calibrated to the operation point.

To implement a two-qubit gate, a sinusoidal pulse is sent on top of the DC flux to the SQUID loop. If the modulation frequency of this pulse matches a transition of the two-qubit system, it will perform a two-qubit gate.
In this way we are able to turn on interactions between specific levels of the qubits (see \cref{chap:2_qubit_gates}).
