    abstract = {Spontaneous emission through a coupled cavity can be a significant decay channel for qubits in circuit quantum electrodynamics. We present a circuit design that effectively eliminates spontaneous emission due to the Purcell effect while maintaining strong coupling to a low-Q cavity. Excellent agreement over a wide range in frequency is found between measured qubit relaxation times and the predictions of a circuit model. Using fast (nanosecond time-scale) flux biasing of the qubit, we demonstrate in situ control of qubit lifetime over a factor of 50. We realize qubit reset with 99.9\\% fidelity in 120 ns.},

  abstract={The counter-intuitive aspects of quantum physics have been illustrated for some time by thought experiments, from Einstein's photon box to Schrödinger's cat. These experiments have now become real, with single particles — electrons, atoms or photons — directly unveiling the weird features of the quantum. State superpositions, entanglement and complementarity define a novel quantum logic that can be harnessed for information processing, raising great hopes for applications. This book describes a class of such thought experiments made real. Juggling with atoms and photons confined in cavities, ions or cold atoms in traps, provides an incentive to shed a new light on the basic concepts of quantum physics. Measurement processes and decoherence at the quantum-classical boundary are highlighted.},

@article{di_carlo,
	abstract = {By exploiting two key aspects of quantum mechanics ---the superposition and entanglement of physical states ---quantum computers may eventually outperform their classical equivalents. A team based at Yale has achieved an important step towards that goal ---the demonstration of the first solid-state quantum processor, which was used to execute two quantum algorithms. Quantum processors based on a few quantum bits have been demonstrated before using nuclear magnetic resonance, cold ion traps and optical systems, all of which bear little resemblance to conventional computers. This new processor is based on superconducting quantum circuits fabricated using conventional nanofabrication technology. There is still a long way to go before quantum computers can challenge the classical type. The processor is very basic, containing just two quantum bits, and operates at a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. But the chip contains all the essential features of a miniature working quantum computer and may prove scalable to more quantum bits and more complex algorithms.},
