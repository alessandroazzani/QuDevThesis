    abstract = {Spontaneous emission through a coupled cavity can be a significant decay channel for qubits in circuit quantum electrodynamics. We present a circuit design that effectively eliminates spontaneous emission due to the Purcell effect while maintaining strong coupling to a low-Q cavity. Excellent agreement over a wide range in frequency is found between measured qubit relaxation times and the predictions of a circuit model. Using fast (nanosecond time-scale) flux biasing of the qubit, we demonstrate in situ control of qubit lifetime over a factor of 50. We realize qubit reset with 99.9\\% fidelity in 120 ns.},
