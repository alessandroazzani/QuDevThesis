This study investigates two aspects of quantum information processing with superconducting circuits: microwave signal crosstalk cancellation and the generation of tree graph states. 
Microwave signal crosstalk poses a significant challenge to the fidelity of operations in superconducting qubits for quantum information processing.
We demonstrate the feasibility of cancelling crosstalk using various techniques and pulse shapes.

We also explore the generation of tree graph states, a specific type of many-body entangled state with applications such as one-way quantum repeaters.
These states offer resilience to photon loss, making them useful for robust quantum communication.
We develop a methodology to generate tree graph states using one of our existing device architectures.
