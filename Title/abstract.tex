This study investigates two critical aspects of quantum information processing in superconducting circuits: microwave signal crosstalk cancellation and the generation of tree graph states. 
Microwave signal crosstalk poses a significant challenge to the fidelity of operations in superconducting qubits for quantum information processing.
We demonstrate the feasibility of mitigating and even completely cancelling crosstalk using various techniques.

We also explore the generation of tree graph states, a specific type of graph state with applications such as one-way quantum repeaters.
These states offer resilience to photon loss, making them useful for robust quantum communication networks.
We develop a methodology to generate tree graph states using one of our existing device architectures.
